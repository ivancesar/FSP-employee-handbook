			<p>We not only help build, validate, and develop an application, but also can provide input to challenge the business model.</p>
		</article>
		<article class="what_we_do_article" id="discovery">
			<p>We take the time to understand our partners’ visions and then craft a team to execute product development and accelerate delivery. Our partners view us as a part of their core team and often look to us for recommendations that support their broader strategy.</p>
		</article>
		<article class="what_we_do_article" id="softwareArchitecture">
			<p>Our Software Architects plan for and guide delivery of your development work streams. A manager from our dedicated architecture team takes on your project and serves as your personal resource for long-term guidance - technical roadmapping, feasibility analysis, and offline business strategy. In addition, your architect oversees and manages the individual tasks completed along the journey to implementation.</p>
			<p>Whether you are a Fortune 500 or a nimble startup, you can greatly benefit from the consultative support provided by one of our Software Architects. Each bringing multiple years of IT delivery experience, our architects go above and beyond in order to assure you’re moving in the right direction. Small companies often utilize our Architects as “Fractional CTO’s” - able to handle all aspects of your technical strategy. Larger companies engage the architecture team as an extension of their existing technology team.</p>

		<article class="what_we_do_article" id="applicationDesign">
			<p>We design user interfaces on all platforms - web, mobile, tablets, flash drives, and even shoes! Because we handle all design prior to development, our process keeps you involved and allows for rapid prototyping and iteration:</p>
			<p>Design Theme Ideation. Overall feature set and concept is explored and in collaboration with our design team, you develop your theme and screen-by-screen outline.</p>
			<p>Use Case Definition & Information Architecture. Largely completed by our design team and Architects, we examine the technical and customer-facing implications of design plans and determine the feasibility and effectiveness of previously ideated plans.</p>
			<p>Low & High Fidelity Wireframing. Using computer models, our design team first creates a basic layout approximation in order to provide a rough visual of the product. Next, a more visualy representative prototype design is created and sent to you for an iterative review.</p>
			<p>Original Artwork & PSD creation. Actual elements of the application are created in preparation for front-end development.</p>
			<p>HTML/CSS or other front end technologies as appropriate. Visual-facing design is coded.</p>
			<p>Cross Platform & Responsive Design-Coded design is optimized for key platforms.</p>

		<article class="what_we_do_article" id="webDevelopment">
			<p>We build applications that can improve workflow efficiency, market your services, or sell products. We specialize in custom applications, CMS frameworks, and e-commerce platforms.</p>
			<p>With our unique partnership-oriented approach, Farshore makes the perfect custom development partner. Before design takes place, our development team learns the DNA of your business- who you are, who your customers are, and where you are going. From there, we architect a product solution specific to your goals. Because of the extent of our resources, we can then build your mobile and web platforms and their supporting APIs.</p>
			<p>We develop beautiful e-commerce stores that are effective on the frontend and efficient for the back office. Often driven by the strength of Magento’s platform, the e-commerce applications we design are feature-rich on the backend and easy to use by your customers.</p>
			<p>We also handle your payment, shipping, and fulfillment needs, integrating custom development as necessary.</p>
			<p>By leveraging industry-standard platforms in the development of your CMS, we access a breadth of features. We’ll customize the backend and integrate frontend design, social networks, e-commerce, and other custom blogging tools.</p>
